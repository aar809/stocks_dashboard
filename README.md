My CS50X Final Project is a Stocks Dashboard that  allows users to input the stock ticker of any stock,
and be able to see the stock price trends and a variety of other financial data presented in the form of an interactive dashboard and tables.

Some basic features include the ability to chart the stock price in the last 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, 5 years, or all; and the
ability to compare 2 stocks' trends side-by-side.
