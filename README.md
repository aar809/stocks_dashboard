<h1>Stocks Analysis Dashboard</h1>
My CS50X Final Project is a Stocks Dashboard made with Python Flask, extracts data from an Finance data API, and displays it on an interactive Plotly dashboard to allow users to input the stock ticker of any stock, and be able to see the stock price trends and a variety of other financial data presented in the form of an interactive dashboard and tables.

Some basic features include the ability to chart the stock price in the last 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, 5 years, or all; and the
ability to compare 2 stocks' trends side-by-side.
